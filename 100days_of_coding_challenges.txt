CHALLENGE 5 :  Count Words in a String - Counts the number of individual words in a string. For added complexity read these strings in from a text file and generate a summary.  SO OUR CODE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A TEXT, AND TELL HOW MANY WORDS ARE IN THAT TEXT. FOR ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY, IT CAN GET THIS TEXT BY READING A FILE                    OPTIONAL : LET YOURS FUNCTION ACTUALLY ANALYSE THE TEXT PASSED IN BY THE USER. IT SHOULD RETURN THE WORD COUNT, ALSO, RETURN THE NUMBER OF DUPLICATE WORDS, FOR EXAMPLE, IF THERE ARE A 100 WORDS, AND THE WORD "THE" APPEARS 3 TIMES, OUR FUNCTION SHOULD TELL US :sunglasses:

TODAY’S CHALLENGE IS PIG LATIN - Pig Latin is a game of alterations played on the English language game. To create the Pig Latin form of an English word the initial consonant sound is transposed to the end of the word and an ay is affixed (Ex.: "banana" would yield anana-bay). Read Wikipedia for more information on rules. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin  ....SUBMISSION OF SOLUTION IS BY 7PM NIGERIAN TIME. HaPpY CodiNg

Pig Latin
Pig Latin is a language game in which words in English are altered. The objective is to conceal the words from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer, as it is simply a form of jargon, used only for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language.

CHALLENGE 7:  D. MixUp
Given strings a and b, return a single string with a and b separated by a space but with the first 2 chars of each string swapped.  
For example:   mix_up(‘mix’ , 'pod’) SHOULD RETURN  'pox mid'
mix_up('dog', ‘dinner’)  SHOULD RETURN  'dig donner'
Assume a and b are length 2 or more.
def mix_up(a, b):

CHALLENGE FOR TODAY IS TAGGED: not_bad
Given a string, find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'bad'. If the 'bad' follows the 'not', replace the whole 'not'...'bad' substring with ‘good’. Return the resulting string.
FOR EXAMPLE: 'This dinner is not that bad!' yields:
This dinner is good! Since ‘not’ appeared before ‘bad’ just change from ‘not....bad’ words to ‘good’. Also, ‘The tea is not hot’ yields ‘The tea is not hot’. No changes because there is no ‘bad’ after ‘not’.  HaPpY CodInG...

CHALLENGE FOR TODAY: front_back
Consider dividing a string into two halves. If the length is even, the front and back halves are the same length. If the length is odd, we'll say that the extra char goes in the front half. e.g. 'abcde', the front half is 'abc', the back half 'de'.
Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form
a-front + b-front + a-back + b-back     
front_back('abcd', ‘xy‘) SHOULD RETURN  'abxcdy'
front_back('abcde', ‘xyz’)  SHOULD RETURN 'abcxydez'
front_back('Kitten', ‘Donut’)  SHOULD RETURN 'KitDontenut')


def front_back(a, b):
